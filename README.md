## Project Overview: Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project aims to predict Tesla's stock prices through the implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The workflow encompasses data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model building, training, and evaluation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project components.

### **Dataset**

The dataset utilized is named `TESLA.csv`, containing historical stock prices with the following columns:
- **Date**
- **Close** (closing price)

### **Workflow**

#### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Loading the Dataset**: Use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to load the CSV file.
- **Date Conversion**: Convert the Date column to a datetime format and set it as the index.
- **Column Management**: Drop unnecessary columns for analysis.

#### **2. Visualization**
- **Historical Trends**: Create plots to visualize stock price trends over time using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

#### **3. Model Development**
- **Data Normalization**: Normalize the data to prepare it for LSTM input.
- **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **LSTM Model Creation**: Build and train the LSTM model using [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

#### **4. Evaluation**
- Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify prediction accuracy.

### **Dependencies**

To successfully run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You can install these libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow

### **Results**

The project will produce:
- Visualizations comparing historical and predicted stock prices.
- Evaluation metrics demonstrating model accuracy.

### **Future Improvements**
To enhance the model's predictive capabilities, consider:
- Incorporating additional features like trading volume or external market indicators.
- Experimenting with different deep learning architectures or hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

### **License**

This project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for free usage and modification.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively predict Tesla's stock prices using LSTM networks, contributing valuable insights into stock market forecasting.
