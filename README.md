# Tesla-Stock-Prices-Predictions-LSTM-
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting Tesla's stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The notebook leverages Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and building an LSTM-based deep learning model.

Overview

The project focuses on:

Loading and preprocessing Tesla stock price data.

Visualizing historical stock price trends.

Building an LSTM model for time series forecasting.

Evaluating the model’s performance.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains Tesla stock prices, loaded from a CSV file named TESLA.csv. It includes the following columns:

Date

Close

Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Loading the dataset using Pandas.

Converting the Date column to datetime format and setting it as the index.

Dropping unnecessary columns.

Visualization:

Plotting historical stock prices to observe trends.

Model Development:

Normalizing the data for LSTM input.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Building and training the LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluation:

Assessing the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

tensorflow/keras

Results

Visualizations showcasing historical and predicted stock prices.

Evaluation metrics demonstrating the model’s accuracy.

Future Improvements

Incorporating additional features such as volume or external market indicators.

Experimenting with different deep learning architectures or hyperparameter tuning.

Steps to Run the Project:

Steps to Run the Project:

Get the Project Files:

Download the files from GitHub by using the command below in your terminal/command prompt:
git clone [https://github.com/BatthulaVinay/tesla-stock-predictions.git]
This will copy the project folder onto your computer.
Open the Project Folder:

After cloning, open the folder where the files are saved:
cd tesla-stock-predictions
Install Necessary Software (Dependencies):

The project needs specific Python libraries to work. Install them by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install libraries like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, etc.
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook by typing:
jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window where you’ll see the project files.
Open the Notebook File:

Click on the file named Tesla Stock Prices Predictions(LSTM).ipynb to open it.
Run Each Code Cell:

Inside the notebook, you’ll see blocks of code. These are called "cells."
Run them one by one by clicking the ▶️ (Run button) or pressing Shift + Enter.
Observe Outputs:

You’ll see the data processing, graphs of stock trends, and the LSTM model training as you go through the notebook.
